## Controls

Player 1 - Arrow Keys
Player 2 - W, A, S, D

## Objective

As you move around the arena, you leave a wall behind you. If you crash into your
own wall, the wall of the other player, or the borders of the arena, you lose.
Make patterns and manipulate your opponent into crashing before you do!

## Features

* An AI that dynamically calculates the optimal re-route based on the length of
squares until the next wall to the right or the left side upon collision.
* Categorization of collision detection to determine a winner or if it was a tie
game.
* Menu select for single player or 2-player modes.
